# FtcUltimateGoalXml
XML configuration files for FtcUltimateGoal

This is an IntelliJ project but the destination
of the XML files is the FTC Robot Controller.

Make changes to the XML files in this project
to take advantage of the schema validation
provided by the xsd files. Validation errors
are highlighted in any open XML file.

The folder structure here exactly mirrors that
of the Robot Controller. However, only the XML
files should be copied to the Robot Controller.

Android Studio does not have a "validating
parser" that makes use of the schema files.
It ignores any references to xsd files.
